get inside chat folder, and run npm install, later install the above packages.

There are 3 active users, listed in /hooks/Storage.js - in the data var.
There are more than 5 contacts, so you can add and create a new chat.

When logging in, use the username Linda and pass Linda123 - there are 5 contacts, and in Hadar's chat there are example to all kind of data types that we can send.

We support uploading videos, images, and recording live×¥

There is no time stamps on the hardcoded logs, but once you send a new message, the timestamps appear in everty messagebubble and in the contact section.
